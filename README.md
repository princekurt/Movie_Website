# Movie_Website
A simple website using Python and HTML. Shows a list of predefined movies, and links you to their trailer. Is fully scripted using 
Python, which creates the HTML file, and opens it during runtime. Python Version used is 3.6.1

# Installation
The files needed to run the project are:   
entertainment_center.py  
design.py  
media.py  

The main function is located in the entertainment_center.py, so the project should be run from here. 

# Heirarchy
entertainment_center (main)  
-->design.py  
-->media.py

# Usage
Make sure Python 3.6.1 is installed when running the program. Open up entertainment_center.py in the Python IDLE editor (Or another program which can run Python).  
All other files listed in hierarchy must be present in the same folder when running the program.  
Run the entertainment_center.py script.  
Script only needs to be run once to create and load the webpage.  
After that, an html file with name "index.html" will be created which is a standalone file, no longer needing the Python scripts.
